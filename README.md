##Homework 8

####Aim of the project:
1. Analize flight path of glider using diferential equations
1. Conduct all calculations for a glider with the aerodynamic efficiency R = 10
1. When producing data fiules for graphs, calculate at least 20 data points, more if the character of the graph
requires finer resolution
1. Prepare gnuplot scripts to generate png graphs from data files
1. Compilation of code, actual calculations, and graphs generation should be controlled by
Makefile

![HW8 problem 1](https://github.com/SteveShaw-phys2200/Homework08/blob/master/glider-velocity.png)

* note max effecient velocity for R=10, glider scrubs speed by looping until reaching steady glide

![HW8 problem 2](https://github.com/SteveShaw-phys2200/Homework08/blob/master/glider-angle.png)

* note glider has greatest range with slightly negitive launch angle, intial velocity + lift is directed best down range under these conditions

* note once glider srubs bit of speed it enters steady dive
